Dani graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2024 with her Bachelor of Science degree in Psychological Sciences and a minor in biology. While at NAU, Dani worked in the Quiet Ego and Well-Being Research Group with Heidi Wayment, Ph.D., completing research regarding emotion regulation, the quiet ego, and adverse childhood experiences. During her undergraduate studies, Dani completed an internship with [Sharon Manor](https://www.housingnaz.org/sharon-manor), a transitional housing program for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Additionally, Dani works part-time, remotely, with [Dr. Chloe Haaz](https://www.montcotherapy.com/), who specializes in psychological and custody evaluations. She has many research interests but is predominantly inclined to work with anxiety-related and mood disorders in late adolescents and young adults, emphasizing the importance of emotion regulation. As Dani nears completion of her Master's degree, she plans to pursue a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology to develop her research and clinical skills further.
